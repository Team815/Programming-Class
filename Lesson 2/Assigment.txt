Assignment #2: Conditional Statements and Loops

--------------------------------

Problem #1
Description: You want to determine if a number is even and/or greater than 100. 
A user inputs an integer, then:
If the number is even, print "Even". 
If the number is greater than 100, print "Greater than 100". 
If the number is both even and greater than 100, print "Both"
If the number is neither even nor greater than 100, print "Neither".

Input: Any integer

Output: One of the following statements
"Even"
"Greater than 100"
"Both
"Neither"

Example #1:
Input = 4
Output = "Even"

Example #2:
Input = 101
Output = "Greater than 100"

Example #3:
Input = 102
Output = "Both"

Example #4:
Input = 3
Output = "Neither"

--------------------------------

Problem #2
Description: A user inputs a string. You want to print every character in the string, 
one at a time.

Input: Any string

Output: Each character in the string on it's own line.

Example #1:
Input = Pizza
Output = 
P
i
z
z
a

Example #2:
Input = Hello World
Output = 
H
e
l
l
o

W

r
l
d

Example #3
Input = dj38fh45j92dk47#
Output = 
d
j

Hint #1: You can see how long a string is by using the length() function, 
like this: stringLength = myString.length()

Hint #2: You can access a single character in the string like this: 
myString.charAt(DESIRED_INDEX), where DESIRED_INDEX is the position of the character in the string minus 1.
For example, if we had myString = "pizza", myString.charAt(0) would equal "p" and myString.charAt(4) would equal "a".
