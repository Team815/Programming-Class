Assignment #5: Class

------------------------------------------------------
Problem Description:
Add an Elevator to the Robot. An Elevator should be 
able to go up, to go down, and we should be able to see
when the elevator is up, down, or moving up or moving down.

Add a new Elevator class to the Robot project we made in
class. If you don't have the code that we made in class, 
you can find the code under lesson 5 on the programming
class repository on GitHub. Add functions to the Elevator
class to "move" the elevator up or down, and one function
to tell us if the elevator is up, down, moving up, or 
moving down.

Hint: If you need an example, look at the Claw that we made.
The Elevator will be very similar to the Claw, except
instead of opening and closing, it will be "moving" up or
down.
